/**
 * Player prop projections.
 *
 * The honest version of a prop model: take what a player has actually done per
 * game, blend this season with last (weighted by how much of this season there
 * is), then scale by the game the model is projecting — a team the engine has
 * scoring 45 will throw and run more than the same team projected for 20.
 *
 * The interval is the part most prop tools skip. A projection of 248 passing
 * yards with a range of 180-320 tells you the over at 249.5 is a coin flip; the
 * point estimate alone does not. Ranges are one standard deviation, using the
 * historical game-to-game spread of each stat rather than anything fitted.
